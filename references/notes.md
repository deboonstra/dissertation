Zhou and Qu (2011)
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2012.682534
Notes: Based on basis matrices to estimate and select correlation structures, which transforms the problem to selection of covariates related correlation structures. Additionally, it does not require specification of a likelihood function. 

Santos, De Bastiani, Uribe-Opazo, and Galea (2023)
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2022.2157874
Notes: Compares directly to QIC, CIC, and RJ for spatially correlated data.

Leung, Wang, and Zhu (2009)
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxp002
Notes: Hybird GEEs and gets around correlation structure selection by combining multiple estimating equations based on multiple correlation structures by the means of the empirical likelihood framework.

Westgate (2014)
File: keep/westgate_2014.pdf
Notes: Discusses TECM and penalties for other selection criteria

Jang (2011)
File: Mijin_Jang_Thesis.pdf
Notes: Completely focused on working correlation structure selection and address the issue of over-parameterization. The new method is based on a disparity measure that is calculated from generalized eigenvalues. The eigenvalues are from the model-based independence and bias-correct robust covariance matrices.

Chen and Lazar (2009)
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1198/jcgs.2011.09128
Notes: Based on empirical likelihood (non-parameteric approach), which encompasses GEEs, as they are semi-parameteric. The authors make comparisons to quasi-likelihood and resampling techniques

Zhou, Song, and Thompson (2011)
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2011.645785
Notes: Proposes an information ratio test for quasi-likelihood inference, which leads to a model selection criterion. Additionally, they briefly mention the quasi-likeihood ratio test.
