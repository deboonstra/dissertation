# Talking points

Exploratory work on expected optimism (eo).

- Computational intensive, I could only do 100 replications after issues arose.
- `eo1`: $\delta(\boldsymbol{\Omega}_{Z}, \mathbf{V}_{Y})$
- `eo2`: $\delta(\boldsymbol{\Omega}_{Y}, \mathbf{V}_{Z})$

# Notes

We only examined the results for the eo work I completed.

- There are serious problems with the eo values because some of them are negative.
- We need to see the average values of `cic_y`, `cic1`, and `cic2` to hopefully see why the calculations for `eo1` and `eo2` are problematic.
- Apparently, it does not matter how the data is generated at this moment.
