# Talking points

- Simulations for $\delta_{0}$
- Simulations for $\delta$
- Next step is to run simulations for CIC and mCIC

# Notes

Model-based $\delta_{0}$ will definitely show us bias and will show variability when $N << n$.

- This can be seen when examining exchangeable for robust and model-based.

Robust $\delta_{0}$ does not show bias but inflation in $\delta_{0}$ is due to variability while model-based show inflation due to bias.

- Independence shows the extreme bias
- AR(1) show more bias and less variability
- AR(3) show less bias due to flexilibity and more variability due to estimating more parameters.
- Unstructured show variability due to estimating more parameters.

Moving forward focus on model-based for $\delta_{0}$ as it show bias and variability due to the structures themselves not due to the covariance structures.
