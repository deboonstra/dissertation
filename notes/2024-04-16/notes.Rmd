# Notes

Test out a new measure

$$
\sum_{i = 1}^{p} max\left\{log\frac{\hat{\mathbf{V}}_{r, ii}}{\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_{ii}}, log\frac{\hat{\boldsymbol{\Sigma}}_{ii}}{\hat{\mathbf{V}}_{r, ii}}\right\},
$$

where this measure will have a minimum of 0. Thus, this measure won't be affected by the mean structure. It will also reign in the outliers.
