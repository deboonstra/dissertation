- Discuss the definition of $\hat{\Omega}_{I}$ in Pan (2001a) and Hin and Wang (2009).
- Discuss the derivation of QKIC using $\hat{\beta}_{I}$ versus $\hat{\beta}_{R}$.

# Notes

We started our conservation and realized the wording of Pan's paper is difficult to understand. However, it is correct. Hin and Wang's paper helped with the notation.

The goal is to create $tr(\hat{\Omega}_{R}\hat{V}_{r})$.
