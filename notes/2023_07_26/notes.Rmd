# Talking points

- Discuss the Prentice and Zhao (1991) paper
- Notation
- How should we proceed? I feel like we are stuck between multiple directions.

# Notes
Using the Ad-Hoc approach we could create our own version of QICu
$$
-2[Q(\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}) + Q(\hat{\boldsymbol{\alpha}})] + 2[p + q],
$$
where $q$ is the number of correlation parameters estimated.

For model-based, the $f_{k}f_{k}^{\top}$ would become $V_{k}$ for Prentice and Zhao (1991) Ad-Hoc covariance matrix.

# Action items

- Explore `PROCE GEE` in SAS to see if Prentice and Zhao is in there.
    - Also, whate are the difference between this procedure and `PROC GENMOD`.
- Email Prentience and Zhao for computing the ad-hoc approach.
- Try transformations based on difference correlation structures.
